//	I have made this header file for two reasons:
// 		It makes data types consistant across the project.
//		Clearly, what data type is used to store the elements of these finite fileds, and the Codes which derive from them, should depend upon the number of elements intended for those finite fields.
//			Giving a name to the data types makes tracking them down for
